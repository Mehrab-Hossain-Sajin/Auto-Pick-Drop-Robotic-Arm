# Auto-Pick-Drop-Robotic-Arm
A Python based 4-DOF (Degree of Freedom) robotic arm system powered by Arduino, designed to autonomously detect, pick, and place objects using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The arm performs a 180Â° sweep to locate objects within an 8cm range, executes a precise servo-controlled pickup sequence, and drops the item into a designated container.
